# Seven-Segment-Display

The individual segments of the display are labelled 'a' to 'g' as follows:

Using a seven segment display, we can display the decimal digits 0-9 like so:

Now we can write a truth table that indicates each digit's truth values for segments 'a' to 'g':


Let's make some digits!

Here, I've connected switches S0 to S6 to segments 'a' to 'g' respectively (as well as S7 to DP).


Huzzah; we have displayed the digits 0-9. Though, I don't think that inputting 01111101 to display a 6 is very intuitive.

What if we wrote some code such that the input has some semantic meaning?
